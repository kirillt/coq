(** This module provides functions to load, open and save
  libraries. Libraries correspond to the subclass of modules that
  coincide with a file on disk (the ".vo" files). Libraries on the
  disk comes with checksums (obtained with the [Digest] module), which
  are checked at loading time to prevent inconsistencies between files
  written at various dates.
