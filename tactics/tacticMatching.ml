(** [t] is the type of matching successes. It ultimately contains a
    {!Tacexpr.glob_tactic_expr} representing the left-hand side of the
    corresponding matching rule, a matching substitution to be
    applied, a context substitution mapping identifier to context like
    those of {!Matching.matching_result}), and a {!Term.constr}
    substitution mapping corresponding to matched hypotheses. *)
type 'a t = {
  subst : Matching.bound_ident_map * Pattern.extended_patvar_map ;
  context : Term.constr Id.Map.t;
  terms : Term.constr Id.Map.t;
  lhs : 'a;
}



(** {6 Utilities} *)


(** Some of the functions of {!Matching} return the substitution with a
    [patvar_map] instead of an [extended_patvar_map]. [adjust] coerces
    substitution of the former type to the latter. *)
let adjust : Matching.bound_ident_map * Pattern.patvar_map ->
             Matching.bound_ident_map * Pattern.extended_patvar_map = fun (l, lc) ->
  (l, Id.Map.map (fun c -> [], c) lc)

    the binding of the right-hand argument shadows that of the left-hand

(** {6 Non-linear patterns} *)


(** The patterns of Ltac are not necessarily linear. Non-linear
    pattern are partially handled by the {!Matching} module, however
    goal patterns are not primitive to {!Matching}, hence we must deal
    with non-linearity between hypotheses and conclusion. Subterms are
    considered equal up to the equality implemented in
    [equal_instances]. *)
(* spiwack: it doesn't seem to be quite the same rule for non-linear
   term patterns and non-linearity between hypotheses and/or
   conclusion. Indeed, in [Matching], matching is made modulo
   syntactic equality, and here we merge modulo conversion. It may be
   a good idea to have an entry point of [Matching] with a partial
   substitution as argument instead of merging substitution here. That
   would ensure consistency. *)
let equal_instances env sigma (ctx',c') (ctx,c) =

      bookkeeping is relegated to a monad: the composition of the
      bactracking monad of {!IStream.t} with a "writer" effect. *)
  (* spiwack: as we don't benefit from the various stream optimisations
     of Haskell, it may be costly to give the monad in direct style such as
     here. We may want to use some continuation passing style. *)
